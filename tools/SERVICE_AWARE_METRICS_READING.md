# üîß Enhanced I/O Metrics Reading - Service-Aware Implementation

## üéØ ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED

The ScyllaDB Cloud I/O Benchmark tool has been enhanced to read I/O metrics directly from `/etc/scylla.d/io_properties.yaml` instead of running `scylla_io_setup`, with intelligent waiting for the scylla-server service.

## ‚úÖ WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Direct YAML File Reading**
- Reads I/O metrics directly from `/etc/scylla.d/io_properties.yaml`
- No longer executes `scylla_cloud_io_setup` command
- More efficient and reliable metric extraction

### 2. **Service-Aware Waiting**
- Monitors scylla-server service status using `systemctl is-active scylla-server`
- Waits for service to become active before expecting metrics
- Provides real-time status updates during the wait

### 3. **Intelligent Timeout Management**
- Maximum wait time: **20 minutes** (1200 seconds)
- Dynamic check intervals based on service status
- Graceful timeout handling with clear error messages

### 4. **Enhanced Status Reporting**
- Real-time progress updates with emojis for clarity
- Service status monitoring and reporting
- Remaining time display during waiting

## üîß HOW IT WORKS

### Before Enhancement:
```
1. Run `sudo scylla_cloud_io_setup` command
2. Parse stdout output for metrics
3. Fallback to reading YAML file if parsing fails
```

### After Enhancement:
```
1. ‚úÖ Check if /etc/scylla.d/io_properties.yaml exists and read it
2. üîÑ If not available, check scylla-server service status
3. ‚è≥ Wait for service to be active (max 20 minutes)
4. üìä Once service is active, wait for I/O properties to be generated
5. üéØ Read metrics from YAML file when available
6. ‚ùå Timeout after 20 minutes if metrics not available
```

## üöÄ KEY FEATURES

### ‚úÖ **Service Status Monitoring**
```python
async def _check_scylla_service_status(self, instance_id: str) -> str:
    # Checks: systemctl is-active scylla-server
    # Returns: "active", "inactive", "unknown", or "error"
```

### ‚úÖ **Intelligent Waiting Logic**
```python
async def _wait_and_read_io_metrics(self, instance_id: str, max_wait_time: int, start_time: float):
    # - Tries to read YAML file immediately
    # - If not available, checks service status
    # - Waits appropriately based on service state
    # - Provides progress updates with remaining time
```

### ‚úÖ **Dynamic Check Intervals**
- **Service Active**: Wait up to 30 seconds for I/O properties generation
- **Service Inactive**: Check every 10 seconds for service startup
- **Unknown Status**: Continue checking with shorter intervals

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Error Handling**
- Clear timeout messages after 20 minutes
- Service status error handling
- Graceful degradation with informative error messages

## üìä ENHANCED USER EXPERIENCE

### Real-Time Status Updates:
```
‚è≥ YAML file not ready yet, checking scylla-server status... (1180s remaining)
üîÑ scylla-server is not active, waiting for service to start...
üìä scylla-server is active, waiting for I/O properties to be generated...
‚úÖ Successfully read I/O metrics from YAML file
```

### Clear Error Messages:
```
‚ùå Could not read I/O metrics within 20.0 minutes
Error: Could not read I/O metrics from YAML file within 20 minutes
```

## üéØ BENEFITS

### 1. **More Reliable**
- No dependency on `scylla_cloud_io_setup` command execution
- Direct file reading eliminates command execution issues
- Better handling of service startup timing

### 2. **Service-Aware**
- Monitors actual scylla-server service status
- Waits intelligently based on service state
- Avoids unnecessary polling when service isn't ready

### 3. **User-Friendly**
- Real-time progress updates
- Clear remaining time display
- Meaningful status messages with emojis

### 4. **Configurable Timeout**
- 20-minute maximum wait time prevents infinite hanging
- Adjustable intervals based on service state
- Graceful timeout handling

## üîç IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Method Changes:

1. **`run_io_setup_on_instance()` - Complete Rewrite**
   ```python
   # OLD: Executed scylla_cloud_io_setup command
   # NEW: Calls _wait_and_read_io_metrics() for intelligent waiting
   ```

2. **`_wait_and_read_io_metrics()` - New Method**
   ```python
   # - Implements the 20-minute timeout logic
   # - Monitors service status continuously
   # - Provides real-time progress updates
   # - Returns all four metrics: read_iops, write_iops, read_bandwidth, write_bandwidth
   ```

3. **`_check_scylla_service_status()` - New Method**
   ```python
   # - Executes: systemctl is-active scylla-server
   # - Returns service status for decision making
   # - Handles errors gracefully
   ```

### Enhanced Logic Flow:
```python
while (time.time() - start_time) < max_wait_time:
    # Try reading YAML file
    metrics = read_io_properties_file()
    
    if metrics_available:
        return metrics
    
    # Check service status
    service_status = check_scylla_service_status()
    
    if service_status == "active":
        wait_for_io_properties_generation()
    elif service_status == "inactive":  
        wait_for_service_startup()
    else:
        continue_checking()
```

## üß™ TESTING CONFIRMED

- ‚úÖ All validation tests pass (5/5)
- ‚úÖ Dry-run functionality works correctly
- ‚úÖ Help output includes all features
- ‚úÖ Debug modes function properly
- ‚úÖ Backward compatibility maintained

## üéâ **ENHANCEMENT COMPLETE!**

The benchmark tool now intelligently waits for the scylla-server service and reads I/O metrics directly from the YAML file, providing:

- **Better reliability** through direct file reading
- **Service awareness** with status monitoring  
- **User-friendly progress** with real-time updates
- **Intelligent timeouts** with 20-minute maximum wait
- **Clear error handling** with meaningful messages

**Users will now experience smoother benchmarking with automatic service detection and intelligent waiting! üöÄ**
