# ScyllaDB Cloud I/O Benchmark - AsyncIO Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the asyncio error: `'_asyncio.Future' object has no attribute '_condition'`

## Root Cause
The error was caused by nested asyncio event loops in the `benchmark_multiple_instance_types` method. The original code was trying to use `asyncio.run()` inside a `loop.run_in_executor()` call, which creates incompatible nested event loops.

## Original Problematic Code
```python
async def benchmark_multiple_instance_types(self, instance_types: List[str], 
                                              image_id: str, runs: int = 3) -> None:
    # Use ThreadPoolExecutor to limit concurrency
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=self.max_concurrent) as executor:
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        
        # Submit all benchmark tasks
        futures = [
            loop.run_in_executor(
                executor,
                lambda itype=instance_type: asyncio.run(  # ❌ PROBLEM: nested asyncio.run()
                    self.benchmark_instance_type(itype, image_id, runs)
                )
            )
            for instance_type in instance_types
        ]
```

## Fixed Code
```python
async def benchmark_multiple_instance_types(self, instance_types: List[str], 
                                              image_id: str, runs: int = 3) -> None:
    # Create semaphore to limit concurrency
    semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(self.max_concurrent)
    
    async def run_benchmark_with_semaphore(instance_type: str):
        """Run benchmark with concurrency limiting"""
        async with semaphore:
            try:
                return await self.benchmark_instance_type(instance_type, image_id, runs)
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Benchmark task failed for {instance_type}: {e}")
                return []
    
    # Submit all benchmark tasks
    tasks = [
        run_benchmark_with_semaphore(instance_type)
        for instance_type in instance_types
    ]
    
    # Wait for all to complete
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed ThreadPoolExecutor**: Eliminated the thread pool executor that was causing the nested loop issue
2. **Used asyncio.Semaphore**: Replaced thread-based concurrency control with asyncio's native semaphore for limiting concurrent operations
3. **Pure async/await**: Used only async/await patterns without mixing thread executors and asyncio.run()
4. **asyncio.gather()**: Used gather() to wait for all tasks to complete concurrently
5. **Proper exception handling**: Added return_exceptions=True to handle individual task failures gracefully

## Benefits of the Fix

- ✅ **Resolves asyncio error**: No more nested event loop conflicts
- ✅ **Better performance**: Native asyncio concurrency is more efficient than thread pools for I/O operations
- ✅ **Cleaner code**: Simpler, more readable async/await patterns
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Individual task failures don't crash the entire benchmark
- ✅ **Resource efficiency**: Uses asyncio's native concurrency primitives

## Testing the Fix

The benchmark tool should now work correctly without the `'_asyncio.Future' object has no attribute '_condition'` error when running commands like:

```bash
python cloud_io_benchmark.py --cloud aws --region us-east-1 --image ami-12345678 --instance-family i4i --runs 3
```

## Files Modified

- `/Users/yaronkaikov/git/scylla-machine-image/tools/cloud_io_benchmark.py`
  - Fixed `benchmark_multiple_instance_types()` method
  - Removed unused `ThreadPoolExecutor` import

The fix maintains all existing functionality while resolving the asyncio compatibility issue that was preventing CSV report generation.
